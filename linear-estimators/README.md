# linear-estimation-tutorial
A showcase application of fundamental concepts of linear algebra, statistics, and computer science. The tutorial develops the mathematical background of linear regression, the requisite functions in base Python to solve OLS estimators, and the benchmark solution with open source tools. It is intended to be accessible to a student audience. 

## Files description:
- lin_est_tut.ipynb - tutorial notebook;
- my_functions.py - linear algebra functions written in base Python; developed in the tutorial.

## Data:
Example dataset; from: https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/california-housing-data-description.

## Requirements:
Unfortunately the requirements file included modules for Jupyter Notebooks and it is not intended to be used when installing. If you have Jupyter Notebooks, pandas, statsmodels, patsy installed then you should be able to run the tutorial.
